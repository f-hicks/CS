## advances in computer vision
### societally beneficial applications
- mapping using earth observation data
- archai.io - Iris Kramer (ECS PhD Grad)
	- use satellite / earth data to scan for archaeological sites before building work can commence
- biometrics
- security and policing
- autonomous vehicles

## Negative Societal Impacts
### speed of diffusion; logical malleability

## Artificial Intelligence "snake oil"
- snake oil liniment has no impact.
- sold to make money but make a difference
- lots of AI snake oil about
- AI is an umbrella term for a set of related technologies
	- machine learning, reasoning and optimisation, computer vision.
- lots of hyperbole around
	- "we've removed the constraints of human knowledge and it is able to create knowledge itself"
	- can be trained against both real world and simulated data

## significant progress in perception tasks
- content identification
	- shazam
	- reverse image search
		- can help identify news/reports
		- can be used to identify/locate people
- face recognition
- medical diagnosis from scans

## some improvements in automated judgement
- spam detection
- plagiarism detection
- automated essay marking
- detecting of hate speech
- content recommendation

## Gen AI and judgement
productivity games
- study by METR with 16 experienced developers
- tools included Cursor pro and Claude 3.5/3.7 sonnet
- developers estimated that using AI reduced task completion time by 20% when actually it slowed developers down by 19%
critical thinking
- study by CHI
- "confidence in AI is associated with reduced critical thinking effort"
- self-confidence is associated with increased critical thinking
- use of AI can lead to long term overreliance and diminished skill levels.

## Fundamentally Dubious AI Applications

predictive job performance
predictive policing
predicting the tendency for criminals to reoffend
predicting terror risk
predicting children at risk

## causes of harms in AI for predicting social outcomes
- hunger for personal data
- massive transfer of power from domain experts & works to unaccountable tech companies
- lack of explanations
	- we don't use deep learning to make decisions (loans etc) because there's no transparency (chief science officer, RBC)
- distracts from interventions
- veneer of accuracy

## governance

"existential risks" warnings from tech companies

recommendations:
- an international scientific panel on AI
- policy dialogue on AI governance
- AI standards board


# Responsible Innovation

Orbit-RRI and UKRI and British Standards Institution PAS440

responsible development of 
- products
- processes
