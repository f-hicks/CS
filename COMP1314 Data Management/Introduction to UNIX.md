## Origins of UNIX
Bell labs made lots of revolutionary technologies

- transistor information theory
- C & C++ programming languages
- many noble prizes won for work done at Bell Labs

MIT, General Electric and Bell Labs built Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) Operating system in the 1960s


## Unix Philosophy
Set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches for minimalistic modular software development.

1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new thing, build something new rather than complicate existing programs by adding new features
2. Expect the output of one program to become the input of another. (Don't clutter the output with unnecessary information)
3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
4. Use tools to lighted the programming task, even if you have to first build the tools and expect to throw some away once used
## Prevalence of UNIX based systems
- over 90% of the internet servers including the likes of Google and Facebook
- UNIX based cloud computing and cloud storage facilities
- Android is UNIX based
- Almost all scientific institutions and research labs employ a UNIX based operating systems.
	- NASA runs Debian on the ISS laptops
	- Primary OS for the Falcon 9 flight computer
## Open Source Software
Source code made available (with a licence) to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose

software developed in a *collaborative* and *public* manner

People improve and adapt it, and can fix bugs
- this happens much faster than conventional software development.

## Linux
- Free and open source operating system
- based on UNIX operating system
- Created in 1991 by *Linus Torvalds* while attending the University of Helsinki
- Has matured to be a very popular operating system
	- over a thousand developers are actively involved in the Linux kernel development
	- Popular versions include:
		- Red Hat
		- Ubuntu
		- Debian
