- programming style
- designing applications (from problem to solution)

## Flavours of programming
Imperative / procedural
 - C / Pascal / Python
Declarative
- Scheme / Python / Haskell 
Object-Oriented
- Java / C++ / Python
- Everything is an Thing
- A program is made up of Things interacted
- Things have both properties and behaviours

## Programming Principles
- Like Algebra
	- x=4
- Not so much like algebra
	- name = "Rover"
- Variables store information / data / values in programs

### Logic

All decisions are based on True or False

### Control flows
Conditional Statements
if size < 10
	dog says "Yip Yip"
else
	dogs says "Ruff Ruff"


human readable versions of programs are called Pseudocode
They look like real programs but are not as precisely defined


### Data structures
- more complex data
- lists
	- multi-dimensional lists
- Dictionaries
	- associate a key with a value

## Skills
- computational thinking
- program design
- IDEs
- Testing/Debugging
